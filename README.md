I have a cunning plan!  This is a game built using React components based on the hit British television show, Blackadder.  The object of the game is to click on each of the characters, but only once.  If you click on a character twice, you lose and have to start over.  Seems simple enough.... except the images shuffle every time!  And given that the same actors play the different characters.... and that they have the same names even though they are hundreds of years apart.... :D

This application was built using a character card component, title component, wrapper component, and a master application component.  The application component does most of the heavy lifting, with supporting the majority of the JavaScript and JSX logic the game itself and for rendering the components.  It also reads the character data from a characters.json, and using props, sends the information to the proper components.

Materialize CSS was used for the UI of this application.
